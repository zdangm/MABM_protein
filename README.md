# MABM
## Cross-ancestry information sharing improves protein abundance prediction and protein-trait association identification in non-Europeans
We introduce a multi-ancestry-based statistical framework, **MABM**, that aggregates multiple statistical imputation models to enhance the accuracy of protein prediction in non-Europeans. This framework can be easily applied to combine cross-ancestry reference proteomic data to bridge the SNP-trait association from large-scale GWAS data for complex polygenic traits.

### Code
This folder contains the main functions of HEAT and TransLasso and an example of their use, as well as example scripts of applying MABM to association analysis.
### Result
This folder contains the prediction model results of MABM for East Asian ancestry, and models with predictive R-square â‰¤ 1% are not included. In addition, we provide the association results of applying MABM to the EAS GWAS summary statistics.
